        <h1>FAQ's</h1>
        <h2>I'm new to programming, which programming language should I learn?</h2>
        <p>According to Stackify, the top 5 most popular programming languages are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>The C Programming Language (C++, C#, C)</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
            <li>Ruby</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Some intro to programming classes use C++, but any of the top 3 most common languages would be a great start!</p>
        <h2>What programming language should I use if I want to create an app?</h2>
        <p>Depends on the platform you want it to run on. If you want to create a software based app (Calculator, Calendar),
            you can use languages like C++ (which can be run through your terminal shell) or Python. From there you can connect
            it to HTML and CSS and make a web application. If you want to create an iOS app, you'll need to use Swift
            (which requires MacOS - Swift runs through XCode which is only available for MacOS). If you want to create an Android
            app, you'll want to use Java (can use any OS, you'll just need to download Android Studio).
        </p>
        <h2>Is it easy to remember different languages?</h2>
        <p>Yes and no. Generally different languages have similar syntax (except for Python. Python is almost like speaking English
        into the computer). Check out the code snippets below to find out how to print in different languages:</p>
        <h3>Swift</h3>
        <code>let name = "Chris"</code>
        <code>print("Hello, \(name)!") // should print "Hello Chris!"</code>
        <h3>C++</h3>
        <code>cout << "Hello World!" << endl;</code>
        <h3>Python</h3>
        <code>print("Hello World!")</code>
